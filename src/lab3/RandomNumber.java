 * @Class RandomNumber
 * @RandomNumber will give a random phone number
 *
 *
 * question:
 * Write a program that creates and prints a random phone number of the form XXX-XXX-XXXX.
 * Include the dashes in the output. Do not let the first three digits contain an 8 or a 9 (but donâ€™t be more
 * restrictive than that), and make sure that the second set of three digits is not greater than 655.And the sum of
 * the last 4 digits should not be greater than21Hint: Think through the easiest way to construct the phone number.
 * Each digit does not have to be, and should not be, determined separately. You are not allowed to use if statements
 * to solve this problem
